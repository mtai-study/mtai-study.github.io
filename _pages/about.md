> To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather.

The Mount Tai Study Circle is a Marxist study circle founded in 2021 in NYC by a group of comrades who have undertaken a rigorous study of MLM. The founders of this circle understand firsthand the value of studying these challenging fundamental texts with others rather than in isolation. We realized that there are many people in the NYC area and beyond that are interested in studying these concepts but do not know where to start. 

The study circle began with one pod composed of a few individuals with very minimal understanding of Marxism who were interested in learning in a group setting. A curriculum was carefully drawn up that covers foundational texts by Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao on scientific socialism, political economy and historical materialism. There is also room for supplemental material including films that can be voted on by members. The track is designed to give its participants a firm grounding in Marxist theory in the most efficient and digestible way possible. The goal is for participants to gain the theoretical foundation necessary to engage in meaningful political work. New pods are formed on an as-need basis, as more small groups of interested folks are brought together and prepared to begin the track. As the circle expands and new pods spring up, the hope is for those who have completed the track to lead studies in these new pods and continue to refine their understanding and build their confidence.
